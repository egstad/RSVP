# Atoms

This directory contains component-level styles for atomic design system elements. These files define the styling for individual UI components that can be combined to create larger interface elements.

All atom files are included within the global SCSS file (`_global.scss`) making their styles available throughout the application.

## Files

### `buttons.scss`

Defines styling for button components including base button styles, variants (primary, secondary, etc.), states (hover, active, disabled), and sizing options. Includes consistent spacing, typography, and interaction patterns following the design system foundations.

### `inputs.scss`

Establishes styling for form input components including text inputs, textareas, selects, and other form controls. Provides consistent appearance, focus states, validation styling, and accessibility features across all input types.
